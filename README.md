### Description

> Kado is designed as a mobile application that serves students' need of studying the notes they took down using digital flashcards.

> Users can customized stacks and cards with the option of placing a tag to each stacks. There are 2 types of card: Front-Back and Fill-In-The-Blank.

> Our application can be accessed from web browser at: <https://kado.vercel.app/>

> Our application can be used by installing our Kado <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uUzB5Ex3eizOgpobHcz6XdK6yQI53mAL/view?usp=sharing">APK file</a> .

> For more information, you may refer to this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jePeCqwEFTXZzWohs4FgmaxjhYTCLmZV/view?usp=sharing">PDF documentation</a> .

### Challenges

1. Although this is not a complex application, the both of us spent quite some time to build the features as we are new to mobile application and the dart programming language and flutter framework.
2. Some features do not work as expected on different platforms for e.g. Google Sign In, Reorderable List-View, PageViews

### Improvements

1. Implement a MCQ type of card.
2. Allow user to place a tag on each card and they can search by card names/tags.

### Technologies

1. Flutter
2. FireBase Authentication
3. Cloud Firestore

> We chose Flutter + Firebase (FlutterFire) as we had no experience with the two technologies and wanted to learn something new. They also have a reputation for working well with each other, as well as for being easy to build with.
